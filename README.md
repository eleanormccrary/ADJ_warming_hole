# ADJ_warming_hole
 
 This story will be focused on a climate phenomenon called the warming hole. I will be using data to show trends over time, as well as illustrate how this area has not warmed as much as the surrounding areas.

I found a comprehensive data guide for climate in Missouri, including maximum and minimum temperatures, which is what I hope to be focusing on. However, the document is not a csv. I will look for other possible data sets and reach out to the School of Natural Resources. In addition, do you know of any ways to transfer this data into a csv file? http://climate.missouri.edu/pdf/Missouri%201981-2010%20Normals.pdf

I also looked into this website: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/daily-summaries/. However, this also wants me to download the data as a PDF. In addition, it said that NCEI Access Systems are currently unavailable.
