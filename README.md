# ADJ_warming_hole
 
 This story will be focused on a climate phenomenon called the warming hole. I will be using data to show trends over time, as well as illustrate how this area has not warmed as much as the surrounding areas.

I found a comprehensive data guide for climate in Missouri, including maximum and minimum temperatures, which is what I hope to be focusing on. However, the document is not a csv. I will look for other possible data sets and reach out to the School of Natural Resources. In addition, do you know of any ways to transfer this data into a csv file? http://climate.missouri.edu/pdf/Missouri%201981-2010%20Normals.pdf

I also looked into this website: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/maps/daily-summaries/. However, this also wants me to download the data as a PDF. In addition, it said that NCEI Access Systems are currently unavailable.

In addition, I submitted a request for a CSV file for data from https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov. I received the data, but when I opened it, only some of the records had maximums and minimums recorded. Furthermore, the website would only let me request a couple months of data at a time, rather than multiple years.

Finally, I looked at the Climate At A Glance website, since there is an very easy way to plug in requirements and get charts. Pat Guinan suggested this. However, when I went to their website and looked at the data tab, the websites it linked either required special permission to access the data or wanted me to download files as GZ files. https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cag. What options are there? Do you know of any other good places to get climate data?
